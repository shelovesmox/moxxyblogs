      <description>So, I decided to start my RE journey by reverse engineering Perimeter X. Currently, I am working on the site grubhub.com and have also checked out a site called airtable.com. Mind you, I have heard about many anti-bots but never brought myself to actually attempt reversing them. From PX to Cloudflare, Shape, and other services like Akamai and Kasada, they have always interested me. It&amp;rsquo;s from both an egotistical perspective and pure curiosity about how they work and whether I can reverse engineer them to bypass their protections.</description>
